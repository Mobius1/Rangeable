# Rangeable

A small dependency-free lib to transform `<input type="range">` elements into something prettier and more configurable.

* No dependencies
* <3kb gzipped
* IE10+
* Touch enabled
* Single or double handles.
* Fully stylable to fit your apps needs.

** Rangeable is still in active development and therefore the API is in constant flux until `v1.0.0`. Check back regularly for any changes and make sure you have the latest version installed.**
